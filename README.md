![](sulfonicdemo.gif)

----

Built as a marketing tool for Permapure, LLC.

* Works with generic USB input controller (joystick, gamepad)
* 'Space' to fire, arrows to move.

#### Install

`git clone`, and `run.sh` to locally compile and execute.

This was previously deployed as an applet, but browsers now disfavor
executing java. Oh well.

#### Libraries:

* [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/).
* [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/), the Lightweight Java Games Library.
